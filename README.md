# Book Management System
This is my first project related to the Dev Init #2 course. It's a straightforward project aimed at practicing CRUD operations with arrays and JSON objects in JavaScript. Users can add, edit, remove, and retrieve lists of books. Additionally, I've implemented some validation to handle missing fields.
